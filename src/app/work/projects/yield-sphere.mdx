## Overview

**YieldSphere** is a decentralized yield farming DApp that allows users to stake tokens and earn rewards. Built as a proof-of-concept and learning project, it combines modern smart contract practices with a sleek front end using **Once UI** and **Tailwind CSS**.

## Features

- 🧠 **Stake & Earn**: Users can stake a mock ERC-20 token to earn reward tokens over time.
- 📈 **Live APR Calculation**: Shows estimated yield rates based on total staked and reward pool.
- 🧪 **Deployed to Testnet**: Works on the Ethereum testnet using test tokens.
- 🌙 **Dark Mode UI**: Styled with Once UI's theme system and Tailwind utilities.
- 💫 **Framer Motion Animations**: Smooth component transitions and loading indicators.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js + App Router** — Web3 frontend architecture
- **Tailwind CSS + Once UI System** — Component styling and dark/light themes
- **Framer Motion** — Animations and feedback
- **Wagmi + Ethers.js** — Web3 hooks and smart contract interaction
- **Hardhat** — Smart contract development and deployment
- **Solidity** — Custom staking smart contracts

## Smart Contract Highlights

- 💰 **Reward Distribution Logic**: Fair and transparent yield calculation based on staking duration and proportion.
- ⛽ **Gas Efficient**: Designed with minimal storage updates and read operations.
- 🔐 **Secure Interactions**: Includes safe math, access control, and time-based reward locks.

## Challenges and Learnings

Building a yield DApp helped me understand the balance between frontend interactivity and on-chain logic. Handling wallet states (connected/disconnected), managing approval flows, and syncing UI with blockchain events were all part of the learning process. Styling with Once UI also improved my component reusability.

## Future Plans

- 🧩 Add multi-token support for LP staking
- 🪙 Integrate real ERC-20 tokens on testnet/mainnet
- 📊 Dashboard for rewards tracking
- 🔄 Compound rewards feature

YieldSphere demonstrates how DeFi mechanics can be visualized clearly and interactively for users. It's a strong foundation for future farming protocols or NFT-based staking apps — and a reflection of my hands-on experience in smart contract development and frontend integration.
