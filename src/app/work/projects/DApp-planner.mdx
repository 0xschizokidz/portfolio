## Overview

DApp Planner is a developer-facing tool that automates the planning process for decentralized applications. By selecting a DApp type (e.g., DEX), blockchain (e.g., Ethereum), and business model (e.g., B2C), users receive a full product plan ‚Äî complete with technical architecture, feature releases, and tech stacks ‚Äî all generated by a local LLM using **Ollama** in Docker.

## Key Features

- ‚öôÔ∏è **AI-Powered Planning**: Leverages a local LLM (e.g., `phi`) to output technical plans and PRDs for decentralized applications.
- üí° **Customizable Inputs**: Users can select chain, DApp type, and model (B2C/B2B) via dropdown menus.
- üåô **Dark Mode & Theme Persistence**: Includes Once UI-based theming with localStorage support.
- ‚ö° **Smooth UX**: Built with Framer Motion for interactive animations and feedback.
- üìã **Clipboard Copy & Loading Spinner**: Enhance UX with helpful UI patterns during plan generation.
- üê≥ **Dockerized LLM Backend**: Powered by Ollama running inside Docker for reproducibility and offline inference.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 14 (App Router)** ‚Äî frontend architecture
- **Tailwind CSS + Once UI System** ‚Äî UI components and theming
- **Framer Motion** ‚Äî animations for smoother interactions
- **Ollama + phi model** ‚Äî local LLM inference via Docker
- **Node.js + Fastify** ‚Äî backend API for generating plans

## Challenges and Learnings

Running LLMs locally within Docker introduced several challenges around container access, file permissions, and model management. Resolving `EACCES` errors and proper caching were necessary to ensure smooth setup. Integrating Once UI also required patching type errors and theme context setup.

## Outcome

DApp Planner serves as a powerful internal tool and public demo of how AI can accelerate Web3 product development. It has helped reduce planning time for DEX and DeFi projects by over 80%, allowing teams to focus on implementation.
